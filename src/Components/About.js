            <h2> Hi, I'm Roy ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

            <p>
              I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2021, majoring in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction, with a minor in Computer Science. Currently, I'm a Software Engineer on GoDaddyâ€™s eCommerce team in the San Francisco Bay area.
            </p>

              I have experience in full-stack web and mobile development, mostly React, Django, Ruby on Rails, and SwiftUI. I've also worked extensively with AWS Lambda and API Gateway in Node.js and TypeScript.

              Bringing ideas to life excites me - it is my goal to build compelling and meaningful products at scale. In my free time, I'm working on Unibuy, an iOS app that digitizes the brick-and-mortar shopping experience for college students.
